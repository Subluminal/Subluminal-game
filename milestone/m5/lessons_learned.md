# We are smarter now
## The lessons we learned over the course of this project

1. We should have used the logger more for debugging, instead of System.out.printlns.
2. Tags for logging would have been very practical. Probably we should have used a different logging library.
3. We should have invested more time in finding out how to start our program in intelliJ to be able to use the debugging feature instead of the logger of System.out.printlns.
