# Program Architecture
Due to the rather complex nature of our project (over 200 classes), we deemed it unfeasable to create a single UML diagram containing all classes. Instead, we decided to illustrate the architecture of our project the following way:  
We picked the most important and relevant classes from the client package as well as from the server package and constructed separate UML diagrams for both to show the most important dependencies within the packages. Additionally, we illustrated the most crucial interactions between client and server in a third UML diagram called ``Game``, as you see below.
