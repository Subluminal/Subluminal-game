\chapter{game concept}
\textsc{The} game Subluminal is set in a futuristic sci-fi setting. You take on the role of a highly advanced artificial intelligence. In your search for more and more resources to increase your processing power you venture into uncharted sectors of the galaxy. As your mothership finds a suitable set of stars to dematerialize, you realize that you are not alone. Other AIs sent their motherships to gather resources for them. So the battle for dominance over the sector begins \ldots

At the beginning of the game, you only control the mothership and the host star system it started in. Its time to assemble a fleet and dematerialize the other players. Every star you control produces ships for your fleet at a constant rate. You can take those ships and send them to other stars to capture them. This way you can steadily increase the size of your fleet and start to gain grater influence. Of course the other players are doing the same, so you need to act fast. There is a catch though - you can't see the fleet movement of other players in real time. The information propagates through space-time at a constant speed, dictated by reality itself. You will always be at a disadvantage regarding enemy player movement.
