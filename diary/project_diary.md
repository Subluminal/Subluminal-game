## Friday, March 2nd, 2018, 1st Meeting (R, D, LG)
### Decisions/ideas:
- **Ideas for game names**: Ether, Far Away, Separation, Delay, Subluminal
- **Team name**: Bordeaux Ink.
- **Basic game principle**: The game happens on an outer space map with stars/planet systems. In the beginning every player has his main ship placed in a random planet system and produces his army of smaller ships with the resources that his planets offer. The goal is to conquer the biggest number of planet systems. The players can inform themselves about the position of their adversaries and in which state of colonialisation other planet systems are by sending out requests. The twist is that the messenger ships take some time to get to their target and back, so when they are back the information is already not the latest anymore and the player has to make decisions upon outdated information.

### Task division:  
**D**: Mockups; graphical sketches  
**R**: Division client/server; definition of the network protocol  
**LG**: Planning of the presentation; definition of the style and structure of upcoming presentations  
**LK**: (Create a git-repository;) Planning of the structure of the git-repository; decision if we should use the IntelliJ-plugin for git
